## What's this?

This is a Chrome browser extension that reminds the user that they should be writing their thesis, every time they open a new browser tab.

## How do I install this?

Create a new folder somewhere convenient on your Mac/PC

Download all the files in the 'extension' folder in this repo, to that folder

Fire up Chrome and go to 'Preferences -> Extensions'

Enable 'Developer Mode' by ticking the box at the top right of the page

Hit 'Load unpacked extension'

Select the folder you created in Step 1

This should now show up in your list of extensions

## How can I change the dates?

You can change the numbers pulled in by the extension by editing stats-script.js.

## Improvements

This is a first iteration. Future improvements could include automatically pulling the number of words/chapters written from a separate github repository where the user's thesis is stored, or adding data visualisations. Of course, this can be adapted to work for any countdown or deadline
